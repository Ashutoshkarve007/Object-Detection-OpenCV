We Have to take images and form corresponding .xml files for bounding boxes.

    1. Build a dataset using OpenCV Selective search segmentation
    https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/06/29/opencv-selective-search-for-object-detection/
    2. Build a CNN for detecting the objects you wish to classify (in our case this will be 0 = Smooth Road, 1 = Cracks, and 2 = Rifle)
    3. Train the model on the images built from the selective search segmentation
    4. When creating a bounding box for a new image, run the image through the selective search segmentation, then grab every piece of the picture.
    5. Run each piece of an image through the algorithm, and whenever the algorithm predicts the object you are looking for mark the locations with a bounding box
    6. If multiple bounding boxes are marked, apply Non-Maxima suppression to include only the box with the high confidence/region of interest (this part I am still figuring outâ€¦ you will see my issue below)
